		<h1> Stargazing With You </h1> 
		<h2> A poem by Marthea Lourdes G. Pebojot </h2> 
		<h3> A clear night sky is a beautiful wonder </h3> 
		<h3> For we can see all the stars hover </h3>
		<h3> That night was the first time I saw the most stunning arrangement of lights </h3>
		<h3> I thought, "what else could be prettier than this sight?" </h3> 
		<h3> I saw Mars, Venus, and the Big Dipper </h3> 
		<h3> Only some of the brightest sights I saw that night </h3> 
		<h3> At that moment, I knew I could never be happier </h3>
		<h3> To be able so see the stars with you under the moonlight </h3> 
		<h3> That evening we spent stargazing </h3> 
		<h3> Was a moment I could never think of forgetting </h3> 
		<h3> The feeling of the cold breeze under a fascinating sky </h3> 
		<h3> Made it feel more real, even while seeing it with my own eyes </h3> 
		<h3> That day itself was eventful </h3>
		<h3> Starting from the moment they gave out hot cocoa </h3> 
		<h3> When we listened to music right after the event was over, </h3>
		<h3> I listened to the rain and felt carefree and peaceful </h3> 
		<h3> We've been friends for years, and I remembered every moment I treasured </h3> 
		<h3> From when we first met to the happy moments we shared together </h3>
		<h3> Yet no other memory could compare to this </h3> 
		<h3> Stargazing with you was definitely a moment of bliss.  </h3>
